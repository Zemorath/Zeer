# Zeer: The Personal Library

## Goal
One of the worst things about collecting books is that it gets difficult to keep track of books after a certain amount. There are some apps and other services that allow you to add books but after a certain amount, they require you to pay. This is my fix for that. The goal of this is to provide a free alternative to keeping track of your hundreds, or maybe even thousands, of books.

## How to use
The Website itself is pretty straightforward. When you land on the page you are greeted with the site title. Underneath the title at the top, there is a navigation bar. When you navigate to the library page, you are greeted with all of the books currently in your library represented as cards. 

Each book has a status banner that is color coordinated and can be changed with the drop down menu to the right. There is also a delete button to remove any books you might not have anymore. If the book does not have a photo, there will also be a photo button that when clicked, prompts you to input a url and will add whatever picture is at the end of that. The card also has the title, author, and isbn of the book. On the navigation bar you have the option to search your library by typing in an author, title, isbn, or status if you want to see all the completed books you may have. To the right of that is another dropdown menu that allows you to sort by various methods.

The next tab is going to be the add book page. When you navigate to that there is a form for you to fill which will add any information of a book you input for now. Soon it will search OpenLibrary API to give you options of books to add and when you select one, it will add that book automatically with all the necessary information. As it is it relies on whatever you type in.

And that's it! Like I said, it's pretty straightforward.

## Future Features

1. Adding the ability to pull options from an online API and choose which book you want to add
2. Add the ability to log in and save libraries to specific accounts
3. Add a use rating to each book
4. Pull average price for each book from online API and keep a running total (to help with those pesky insurance people if anything happens)
